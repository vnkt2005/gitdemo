# How to create a new folder in github?

<p>
  You cannot create an empty folder. But you can create a file within a new folder. It is similar to creating a new file, but while giving the file name, prefix it with the folder name. For example, to create file1.txt within demo folder, give the filename as demo/file1.txt.
